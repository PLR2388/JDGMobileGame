## SoundList

`SoundList` provides a structured way to categorize and access the game's audio assets. It consists of two enumerations: `Music` and `SoundEffect`. The `Music` enum lists the different musical themes, such as `MainTheme`, `CanardCity`, and `Wizard`, among others. Meanwhile, the `SoundEffect` enum catalogs various in-game sound effects like `Back` and `Transition`. This system ensures organized and easy retrieval of audio assets for enhancing the game's auditory experience.
